ESP32 Fan Control with DHT11 Sensor

Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 microcontroller along with a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to control a fan. The ESP32 reads data from the DHT11 sensor, decides whether the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, and controls the fan accordingly.


Features         
Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: The DHT11 sensor provides real-time temperature and humidity data.

Fan Control: The ESP32 adjusts the fan speed based on the temperature readings.

Threshold Configuration: Easily configure temperature thresholds for fan activation.

Hardware Requirements    

ESP32 microcontroller
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
Fan (3D printed)
DC motor
